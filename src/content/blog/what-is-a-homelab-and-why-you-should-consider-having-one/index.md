This is a resource of all the homelab services that I use. Some of these are hsoted on my homelab and some of these are cloud services. But all of them are free and easy to use. The goal of this blog is to provide you with a collection of useful services that you should have in your homelab too. This is just the starting point and you can add as many services as you want.

## What is Homelab?

Homelab is the name given to the server(s) that reside locally in your home that you can use for various functions such as virtualization, testing, NAS, media server etc. 

This server can be a raspberry pi, an old pc/laptop or any other computer. 

For my homelab I use the Asrock Deskmeet x600, it is a mini ITX barebone unit. It is a great fit for a homelab due to its compact size but not a lot of compromises. The specs are:

1. **CPU:** Ryzen 7 5700G
2. **RAM:** 64GB DDR4
3. **Storage:** 

   * Internal - 500GB + 4TB
   * External - 4TB + 1TB
   * Network - 1TB

2. Synology NAS
3. Router + Wifi Access point
